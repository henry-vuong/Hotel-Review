# Hotel-Review
In this project, we are going to analyst customer review about the hotels in the EU to see which hotel have a better review and which season in the year there will be a lower review from the customer to be able to help the business improve the customer service and improve the customer experience

In the first notebook, I process some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) steps to clean the dataset

In the second notebook, I will use several machine learning models to correctly label the sentiment behind hotel reviews:
  -  Logistic Regression
  -  K-Nearest Neighbour classifier
  -  Decision Tree classifier

I also perform Tuning Hyperparameters for those model
